The controller will be responsible to get inputs from the user and run the experiment. 
Informations such as what are the preprocessing algorithms, models, how many ML process 
to run or the time to take into the experiment. After the experiment runs, the controller will
resonsible to save and communicate the results.

Glossary:
Experiment -> Test different ML process to find the best for a given dataset and problem.
ML Process -> Combination of Preprocessing Algorithms and Model to get to a prediction.
