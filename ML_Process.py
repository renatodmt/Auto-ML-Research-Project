'''
This class will be responsible to receive the preprocessing algorithms and estimator from the controller,
create a dynamic pipeline, train, predict and score the pipeline, communicate back to the controller the results.
The ML Process saves the trained preprocessing algorithms and estimator to be used to restimate the model in the test period.
